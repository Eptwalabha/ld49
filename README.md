# Crane simulator

Enter the wonderful world of building constructions with this state of the art simulator.

It's so real, I had to remove the sounds and musics so you can distinguish between this and the real world.  
I know... it's that good... trust me (although you shouldn't)

## How to play

You are a construction worker for a very respectable housing companyâ€¦ let say Evergrande.  
Your goal is to build all the projects as thoroughly as possible... the problem is... your crane is kind of broken and you can only drop building block from the sky.

Don't worry, I'm sure you'll be fine.

Did I mention the deadlines on top of that?

A building is completed once it matches at least 80% the objective.

## Controls:

Sorry, I couldn't make it easier...
- `Tab`: view the project
- `Mouse`: operate the crane
- `Mouse scroll`: change block type
- `Left click`: drop the block
- `Right click`: delete the block
- `Middle click` + `Mouse drag`: move the camera around
- `Ctrl` + `Mouse`: rotate the block
- `Ctrl` + `Mouse scroll`: zoom in/out

## Files:

I made everything, except for the fonts that I probably found on freefont.org  
Which means that all files in this project are free to use and are all available to download on github.

that includes:
- `ld49.blend`: contains all 3D models and materials
- all image files
- the code (but you will probably find atrocious things there)

If I forgot to include anything, don't hesitate to ask in the comments.

## What next?

I'll try to post a HTML version soon
